# Blackjack
This is a course project I built as part of The Complete Python Bootcamp.  Gameplay comprises a player vs. computer, and classes are created for card, deck, player hand, and chips.  Functions are created for betting, hitting, revealing a hand, and end game scenarios.  The game logic is executed within a while loop.  Code formatted with black.
